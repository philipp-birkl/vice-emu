Prerequisites:
--------------

- update README and NEWS

- update the html pages in doc/html

- make sure the version in configure.proto is updated and it's updated in other 
  files

- ANNOUNCE A CODE FREEZE ;)


generate tarball:
-----------------

(make sure dos2unix is installed)

first update and clean your sourcetree

$ svn up
$ make distclean

now configure the source tree with sid engines and ffmpeg included. this is
needed because make dist propagates through the source tree, and if resid and/or 
ffmpeg is not configured they will not have any makefiles to get 'make dist'ed

$ ./configure --with-resid --disable-external-ffmpeg --enable-static-ffmpeg
$ make dist


create a tagged branch on the svn

$ svn cp <url of svn trunk> <url of svn tag>


publish the release
-------------------

- upload changes to the website on sf

- upload the tarball to sf

- announce the release on the ml (and eventually elsewhere)

- update the TODO wiki page (remove old crossed out things)

- PROFIT!!!
